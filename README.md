Small Sublime Text 3 plugin I wrote a while back.
It adds a text command which allows you to open a CMD prompt at the current file's directory

Only works on Windows. It could be installed like this:
```
git clone git@github.com:OmriSteiner/opencmdhere.git "%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\opencmdhere"
```
